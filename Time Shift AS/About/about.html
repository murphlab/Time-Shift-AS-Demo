<p><em>SF Time Lapse</em> began as an exhibit created by Ken Murphy as an Artist in Residence at the <a href="http://www.exploratorium.edu">Exploratorium</a> museum in San Francisco.  The original exhibit, entitled <em>Time Shift</em>, can be seen at the museum's Observatory gallery. This version features many of the same time-lapse sequences.<p>

<p>Time-lapse photography allows the viewer to tune in to a different time frame and observe phenomena that might otherwise go unnoticed. These sequences reveal human and natural processes at work in the San Francisco Bay Area landscape, such as tides, ships, air traffic, and weather.<p>

<p>Ken Murphy is a tinkerer, programmer, and artist working in a variety of media.  In his time-lapse work, he's developed unconventional techniques for capturing and presenting time-lapse imagery, and specializes in long-term projects, some which span several years.
