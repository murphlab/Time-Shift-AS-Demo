Time-Shift-AS-Demo
==================

Demo Version of Time Shift AS app. It's in the App Store as "SF Time Lapse."

This began as an Artist in Residency project at the Exploratorium: a time-lapse exhibit using an iPad as the user interface. I redeisgned for distrubution through the App Store. This demo contains the source code, but the video files are not included.
